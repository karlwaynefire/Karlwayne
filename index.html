      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>Fifteen years ago, I experienced a devastating fire that took the life of my beloved wife. That tragedy changed everything. I dedicated my life to becoming the firefighter I wished had arrived sooner. Through years of service, I’ve saved lives, educated communities, and earned recognition from my peers. Today, I work as a freelance firefighter and consultant, extending my services across New York and nearby regions.</p>
      <p>Every mission I take is personal. My commitment is not just to put out fires—but to prevent them, prepare others, and be the calm in chaos.</p>

      <h2>Fire Safety Tips</h2>
      <ul class="tips-list">
        <li><strong>Install Smoke Detectors:</strong> Make sure every floor and room has a working smoke detector. Test monthly and replace batteries twice a year.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Exits Clear:</strong> Never block doors or windows with furniture or clutter—clear exits can save lives in emergencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overload Outlets:</strong> Plug one high-wattage appliance into each outlet to prevent overheating and electrical fires.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay in the Kitchen:</strong> Never leave cooking unattended. Unattended stoves are a leading cause of house fires.</li>
        <li><strong>Have an Escape Plan:</strong> Create a family evacuation plan with two exit routes and practice it regularly.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Heaters Safely:</strong> Keep flammable items at least 3 feet away from space heaters. Turn them off when you leave the room or go to bed.</li>
      </ul>
